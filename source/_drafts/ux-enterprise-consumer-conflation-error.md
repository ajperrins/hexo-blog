title: UX Design Error in the Enterprise Software Space
---
I rented a tuxedo from Men's Warehouse since I was in a good friend's wedding. The person who helped me recorded everything on an iPad: my measurements, my credit card number, notes on my pick-up location preference, and so on.  She hated using this app, but management insisted she do so unless it malfunctioned or put the sale at risk due to slowness (she told me it did in the past with other customers). 


She'd used her P.O.S. system - an ASCII terminal-based application - for years before the tablet, and knew every shortcut key and screen by heart: no mouse, no finger taps 'n swipes 'n types. She moved quickly and was happy. Customers were happy. I suspect it may have taken more time to *learn* the TTY system when she started, but after two years on the tablet she still hated it, and I doubt the same was true for her "console app".
