This blog is generated using [Hexo](hexo.io) - a popular node-based blogging framework. I write posts in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), then generate a serverless/static site by running `hexo generate` and post that content to my pages repo.

Hexo's [themes](https://hexo.io/themes/) are nice, too. I chose Icarus ([sample page](http://blog.zhangruipeng.me/hexo-theme-icarus/), [github source](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus)), written by a community member.
